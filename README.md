# GUI-Practice

I'm learning about AngularJS on www.w3schools.com. I also want to become more familiar with github and how it works with gitkraken.

Therefore, I'm creating my first repo on github to explore how it can help me code better.

There will be .js files saved on this repo that I'll be working on to practice the new skills I'll be learning about AngularJS.

This Github repo will contain code from an online tutorial on youtube. I want to make changes to it to immerse myself in the AngularJS.
